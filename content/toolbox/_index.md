title: Technology Toolbox
---

- [Google Slides](https://slides.google.com/) I've used Google slides for a variety of different things, from making presentation, to making video. I believe that this will be particularly useful for me when running the class in general.
- [Cospace](https://edu.cospaces.io) This tool is very interesting, I used it to create a 3D tour of the LIGO laboratory that is used to research Gravitational waves. I think this tool will be useful for me when I want the learner to explore and learn about a space.
- [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com) This tool is used for 3D designs, I believe that this tool helps me in teaching because it allows the students to be creative and come up with a design to solve a problem they discover, this also allows students to gain CAD skills.
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) This tool will help student think like a computer. Algorithmic thinking is increasing more important in today's technology filled world, using scratch, students can develope their own interactive program.
- [Padlet](https://padlet.com) This tool is my favourate from this semester, it engages and encourages collaboration between students, either as individuals or as groups. I think this may be particularly useful for me when it comes to doing in-class group assignments.
