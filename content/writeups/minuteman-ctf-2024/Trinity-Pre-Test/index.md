## Author Writeup for Trinity Pre Test

Trinity Pre Test was a rev challenge I wrote for Minuteman CTF 2024, which is the first beginner oriented event for the UMass Cybersecurity Club

The challenge is distributed in the form of x86 and arm assembly, you can see them here [x86]() and [armv7]()

I will be focusing on the arm assembly specifically in this write up.
