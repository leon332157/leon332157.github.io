Hi, I'm Leon, currently a junior in Data Science/Computer Science Minor at UMass Amherst.

My current main topic of interest is Reverse Engineering, Vulnerability Analysis, Low level computing, which includes working with X86-64 assembly.

However, my other interests includes Computer Networking stack, Infrastructure deployment with Cloud environment such as AWS and GCP, as well as computer hardware, Linux Kernel and hardware-software interface.

As side hobbies I have a personal server setup at home, as well as a collection of ARM and RISC-V mini computers to experiment with different architectures. I also participate in CTF challenges with the UMass Cybersecurity club team SavedByTheShell.

Outside of technical things, I'm an active member of [Boston Virtual ARTCC](https://bvartcc.com), I have completed the WINGS flight training program in July 2024, as part of my interest in flight simulation and flight training.
